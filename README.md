Overall goal is improve my modding skills and integrate this mod better with the main game.
Planned:
- Set decision types for the three holding conversion decisions. (Custom if that is possible, otherwise will be under realm or domain)
- Change cost of temple holding to include piety.
- Increase cost of city holdings
- All costs will be reduced or increased with traits
- Stress gain/loss depending on traits. Example: cynical will gain stress with temple conversions, zealous will lose it. Greedy will like city conversions.

Potential:
- Vassal opinion loss or gain?
- "Hold Court" events regarding converting holdings?
- Request from head of faith to make temples?
-
